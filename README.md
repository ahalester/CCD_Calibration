Wasn't sure where to put this but since this is pretty visible it seemed like a good place.

** **NOTICE** **

I (NB) will probably do most of my editing on a windows machine so this may result in other platforms getting confused by line ending characters (has happened to me with Windows and Mac). Watch out for that happening and if all the lines are messed up or ending with weird characters when you download a file that is likely the culprit.

Somebody should look into this and maybe make a script to sanitize line endings to run before making commits.
